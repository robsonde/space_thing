thing I want to get done next / soon.


********DONE***************
1.  code to move player (and his ship)  between planets.
from where we are now to where to want to go.
checks fuel, moves to new location.
********DONE***************


********DONE***************
2.  basic menu type system to make testing a bit more like playing the game.
just options in a text input, buy, sell, move to planet
like a phone menu, 1 for fly to planet, 2 for buy, 3 for sell, etc 
********DONE***************


3.  planet description generator.
random description generator, 20+ base sentances, list of nouns and verbs.
creates about 4 some what random phrases that describe the planet.



4.  planet location code.
setup planets at random locations. think it will just be a 2D x,y system.
then we can calculate fuel required and used.



5.  add fuel as a thing you can buy.
fuel is something you buy but not a like cargo, more like a ship upgrade.
a given ship type can only hold so much fuel.
