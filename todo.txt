thing I want to get done next / soon.

1.  code to move player (and his ship)  between planets.
from where we are now to where to want to go.
checks fuel, moves to new location.


2.  basic menu type system to make testing a bit more like playing the game.
just options in a text input, buy, sell, move to planet
like a phone menu, 1 for fly to planet, 2 for buy, 3 for sell, etc 


3.  planet description generator.
random description generator, 20+ base sentances, list of nouns and verbs.
creates about 4 some what random phrases that describe the planet.


4.  planet location code.
setup planets at random locations. think it will just be a 2D x,y system.
then we can calculate fuel required and used.


5.  add fuel as a thing you can buy.
fuel is something you buy but not a like carga, more like a ship upgrade.
a given ship type can only hold so much fuel.
